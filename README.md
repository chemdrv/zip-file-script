Script to solve Renee's zip file problem


It's a little script that takes a folder full of PDFs and splits them into zip files of about the same size. Right now it's all in a Jupyter notebook and the max file size is hard coded in. It just zips whatever folder you're in. If I get motivated, I'll change it so that you can give it a path and a files size, and have it zip according to those specs.
