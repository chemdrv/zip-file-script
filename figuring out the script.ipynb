    "The way this works. First it grabs a list of every pdf in the folder you're currently in. So, you need to be in the right folder. I can also change it to take a path as a variable, I just haven't bothered to be that clever yet. But anyway, `glob.glob('*pdf')` is the line that grabs all filenames meeting the spec of being a PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then it does some initial setup. I set the size of the target file in kb. `archive_number` is an iterator to set what zip file number I'm in. Then I construct the filename for the first zip file and open it up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there's the loop to actually do it. Within the loop, it's stepping through each file in the glob. It writes each file, and then checks the zip file size. If the file size has gone over the target size, that triggers the `if` statement. Within that statement, the current file is closed, the archive number is increased by one, and a new archive opened up.\n",
